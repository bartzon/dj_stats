Delayed Job statistics aggregator
=================================

After seeing the Github guys release Resque, I wanted the same monitoring functionality for Delayed Job. So, DJ Stats was born. It hooks into the lifecycle of a Delayed::Job, and reports data back to DJ Stats. This application is the aggregator part, for the reporting part see http://github.com/bartzon/dj_stats_reporter

Installation:
-------------

git clone git://github.com/bartzon/dj_stats.git

Install the DJ Stats reporter in the apps you want monitor. See http://github.com/bartzon/dj_stats_reporter for more info.
